# Security Policy

## Supported versions

rightsize-rust has not yet made a tagged release; security fixes land on `main`.
Once tagged releases begin, this section will list which minor version lines
receive security patches.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for suspected security
vulnerabilities. Instead, report privately:

- If GitHub's private vulnerability reporting is enabled on this repository, use
  **Security > Report a vulnerability** in the GitHub UI.
- Otherwise, contact the maintainer (see the `authors` entry in the crate
  metadata, or the repository's commit history) with a description of the
  issue, affected version(s)/commit, and reproduction steps if available.

Please include:

- Which backend(s) are affected (Docker, microsandbox, or both).
- Whether the issue requires a specific platform (e.g. Linux + KVM, Apple
  Silicon) to reproduce.
- Any relevant logs — but redact anything sensitive from your own environment.

We'll acknowledge reports as promptly as we can and follow up with a plan once
the issue is confirmed. Coordinated disclosure is appreciated; please give us a
reasonable window to ship a fix before public disclosure.

## Scope notes

rightsize-rust provisions and runs external runtimes (`msb`, and the Docker
daemon over its unix-socket HTTP API) on the developer's machine to support
integration testing. Reports involving the security posture of those runtimes
themselves (rather than how rightsize-rust invokes them) should generally go to
their respective upstream projects, but please report to us as well if you're
unsure — we'd rather triage a report that turns out to be upstream than have
it go unreported.
